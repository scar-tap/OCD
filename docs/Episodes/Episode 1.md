# Episode 1
# Thoughts

1. I may have came into contact with something that may make me fall ill.

# Behaviours
1. Many times I would lick the part I believed to have come into contact with a contaminate/bacteria followed with a “c’est la vie” outlook. (I note that this worry did not stem from responsibility or protection of others, but purely for myself becoming ill)
