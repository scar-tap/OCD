# Thoughts
1. If the garage light was left on, then it could cause a fire that could lead to a loss of life in my family. This then extended to other electrical outlets.
2. If I was the last person to leave the house and a window was open or door was unlocked, there could be a burglary and my family could lose their possessions.

# Behaviours
1. Repeatedly checking light switches, switches on wall outlets, and in some cases I suspect unplugging objects as redundancy or a “fail-safe”, most likely to increase my confidence that an object was off.
2. Ensuring all windows and doors are shut and locked. Repeatedly checking, and repeatedly returning to check and forcefully test my front door to ensure I had locked it sufficiently.
