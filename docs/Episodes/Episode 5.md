# Context
1. I bought a bag of peanuts and was eating them in a best friendâ€™s car, they asked if anyone were eating peanuts, once I said I was, they told me that were allergic to peanuts. (Not it a harsh or accusatory manner, more just as for awareness).

# Thoughts
1. I could fatally harm a best friend if I triggered an allergy.

# Behaviours
1. Avoid peanuts
2. Prevent any potential objects that may be cross-contaminated with traces of peanuts (e.g. a bag set down in a bar where they broke peanuts and left the shells on the floor) from coming into contact with the person.
