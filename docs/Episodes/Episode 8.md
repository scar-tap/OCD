# Episode 8
# Context
1. I entered a new job and learnt that the manager has a family member with HIV.
2. There had been 2 incidents the family member had in which the manager demonstrated an amount of caution:
2. 1. Falling over in town and hurting their back
2. 2. A child the family member worked with scratched the family member’s eye.
3. Just Before I became aware of their family member’s condition, the manager gave me a stack of magazines.
4. They also took my work laptop home to bring it to our other office the following week. They were then off ill so I had to visit their residence to get my laptop (again, prior to me becoming aware of their family member).

# Behaviours
1. Excessive hand washing.
2. Washing objects unnecessarily.
3. Daily washing of clothes worn in the hospital and at my friend’s.
4. Showering twice daily.
5. When dealing with carcinogens (in this case, printer toner), I would avoid it at every possible cost. Items/surfaces that may have come into contact with it I attributed/designated as harmful.
6. Whilst working in the hospital itself, I would go around a open doors with my little finger on my non-dominant hand.
7. Moving from the hospital to an office where colleagues had cold sores and poor bathroom hygiene. I would avoid using handles where possible, opting to use feet/elbows, etc. I still do this.
8. I would avoid contact with colleagues when they had a cold sore and anything they have come into contact with vehemently.
