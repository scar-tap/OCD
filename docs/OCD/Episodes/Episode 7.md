# Context
1. Joining the NHS, I was shown an induction video on how cross contamination can spread so far, “specifically a claim that something can spread around the world with just 3 people.”
2. Working in a hospital, colleagues would use their little finger on their non-dominant hand to open doors as we went around the organisation, this is something I adopted.
3. I worked along side colleagues that had cold sores.
4. I was aware of a colleague leaving a bathroom stall and exiting without washing their hands.
5. I started working with items containing carcinogens.
6. A best friend’s mum got into a relationship with a person who started staying with them. The person revealed they had Hepatitis C in secrecy to another best friend of mine who then made us aware out of concern for our safety. (The person would regularly leave pools of blood.)

# Behaviours
1. Excessive hand washing.
2. Washing objects unnecessarily e.g. phones that weren’t waterproof.
3. Daily washing of clothes worn in the hospital and at my friend’s.
4. Showering twice daily.
5. When dealing with carcinogens (in this case, printer toner), I would avoid it at every possible cost. Items/surfaces that may have come into contact with it I attributed/designated as harmful.
6. Whilst working in the hospital itself, I would go around a open doors with my little finger on my non-dominant hand.
7. Moving from the hospital to an office where colleagues had cold sores and poor bathroom hygiene. I would avoid using handles where possible, opting to use feet/elbows, etc. I still do this.
8. I would avoid contact with colleagues when they had a cold sore and anything they have come into contact with vehemently.
