# Context
I had been working with trigrams in a previous role and 3 letters in “nonce” were being used. Trying not to think of the word “nonce” led to the word “paedo” or “paedophile” becoming an intrusive thought. I wouldn’t trust I hadn’t typed any of these words so would repeat the work I have done to ensure no errors and potential for offence.

This then led to unwanted thoughts of “what else could contaminate”, this has led to the acronyms “HIV”, “AIDS”, my previous manager’s name and their family member’s name triggering anxiety against digital activity. This could be saving a file, filling in a form, buying something online, installing something, etc. if I think of one of these 4 thoughts, a status or attribute is assigned to the object, this could be a file, a physical purchase, an application on my phone, etc.

I have to repeat the action until I complete it without thinking of any of the above.

My previous manager’s name triggers less anxiety of the 4 for me.

Sometimes these thoughts can “retrospectively” assign to an action (e.g. a thought after a purchase may “contaminate” it.)

Thoughts of physical purchases covered in blood may make me feel the object is contaminated.

My current contamination on radiators in  the house and the wall outside comes from my previous manager touching my phone. I wasn’t able to decontaminate it to an acceptable standard. This phone was placed on an old bedside table, then on a hob with the thought process that after I’ve cleaned it, the hob could be disinfected with heat.

The phone gathered dust and when moving, I placed this dust in the kitchen sink before moving the phone. My partner then touched this dust in the sink and then drove to our current house placing her wallet and phone on storage next to the downstairs radiator in the hallway. This radiator has a cover over it.

I could not validate if the phone’s charger cable came into contact with the phone and then the previous bed. Through cross-contamination, effecting the bed.

This was then moved to our new place and stored in the front room.

Following this, it was moved for disposal and left for pick up outside our back garden against a neighbour’s wall, covered in plastic.

The wall it was against in the front room has its wallpaper removed and sanded, some of the dust may have landed on the front room radiator, as such I’ve deemed this as contaminated as i couldn’t validate if it was or not.

This radiator is also covered with a radiator cover.

8. If I have any sensation when passing the hallway radiator (e.g. watch vibrating, cat brushing past, water dropping, spider web, draft over the hairs of my arms), I need to “rewind” and repeat passing by until I feel I’ve passed without any distractions and feel right.
