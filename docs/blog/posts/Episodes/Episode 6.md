# Thoughts
1. I could father an unwanted child by accident if any amount of semen - even when logically non-existent - ended up on clothing or skin and had the potential to be transferred via cross-contamination.

# Behaviours
1. Washing surfaces/objects that I thought could be potentially contaminated.
2. Avoiding the use of front pockets of jeans (both items and hands).
