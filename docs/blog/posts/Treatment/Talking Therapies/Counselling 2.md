# Context
- Through occupational health, a consultant suggested I may have OCD. 2 years later, through the same occupational health, I pursued therapy.
- This had been weekly sessions from 2021-01 to roughly 2021-09.
- The therapy offered was counselling under “Human Givens” theory, both via phone call and in person.
